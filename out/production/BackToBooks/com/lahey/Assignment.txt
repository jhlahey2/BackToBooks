Create an application to keep track of books. Yes. Again.

But this time, you'll also keep track of the authors of the books. The authors will have the following:

- First Name

- Last Name

- Email address

- Phone number



Books will have the following:

- Title

- ISBN

- Author



Your application should allow a user to:

* Create a new book. The book does not have to have an author, but if it does, the author should be selected from a pre-existing list.

* Create an author. When an author is created, as many books as a user would like can be added to that author. The title of the book and ISBN should be required. The book will have only one author for our purposes.

* Add a book to an author

* List all authors and the books that they wrote
